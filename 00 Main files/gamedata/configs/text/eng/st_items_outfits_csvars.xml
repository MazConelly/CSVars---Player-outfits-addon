		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]A light suit worn by Clear Sky's novice researchers. It provides more than adequate protection from the anomalous phenomena in the Swamps, but does little to protect from physical threats or radiological phenomena.\n
		The Renegades' fixation with the Swamp brings them to clash continually with Clear Sky. It's natural for fallen equipment to exchange hands, and Clear Sky equipment is much better than what the Renegades own. These outfits end up in their hands in quite a bad state, and repairing them with their poor means turns them into subpar equipment. Though no matter what their state, it would guarantee to anger any Clear Sky member seeing it.\n</text>

		While Clear Sky doesn't part easily with their self made equipment, none of their members remembers clashing with Sin yet. So no one is quite sure how a relatively new faction managed to get a hold of their equipment, implying a connection with Monolith, or perhaps some more disturbing ways. In any case, most samples seem to have been ritually desecrated; while they still offer decent protection, one shouldn't expect it to last for long under duress.\n</text>

		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]A heavier modification of the CS-1 body armour, with heavier clothes for improved carry load and protection, intended for Clear Sky scouts, couriers, guides, and even medical embers moving far into the north of the Zone.

	<string id="csky_scout_outfit_neutral_description">
		<text>%c[ui_gray_1]A CS-1a in urban camo, wearing a loner badge. Worn by Clear Sky scouts that spend more time scouting urban locations like Limansk, or who try to mingle among loners for any variety of reasons, from simply being ex-members to inconspicuous espionage. Clear Sky have also been selling these to loners as a way to recover economically, and stalkers consider it a good quality alternative to Sunrise outfits, if not entirely easy to acquire due to the remoteness and caginess of Clear Sky.\n</text>
